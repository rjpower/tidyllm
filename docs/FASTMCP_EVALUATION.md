# FastMCP vs TidyLLM: Evaluation and Recommendation

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation: Continue with TidyLLM**

While FastMCP offers a more comprehensive framework with advanced features, TidyLLM's focused approach on tool management with automatic schema generation is better suited for this project's specific needs. The migration effort would not justify the benefits gained.

## Detailed Comparison

### Architecture & Philosophy

**TidyLLM (Current)**
- **Focus**: Lightweight tool management for LLMs
- **Design**: Simple decorator-based registration with automatic schema generation
- **Core strength**: Minimal boilerplate, automatic CLI generation, clean API

**FastMCP**
- **Focus**: Full MCP (Model Context Protocol) implementation
- **Design**: Server/client architecture with comprehensive context management
- **Core strength**: Rich feature set for building AI-powered applications

### Feature Comparison

| Feature | TidyLLM | FastMCP | Winner |
|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| Tool Registration | `@register` decorator | MCP protocol | TidyLLM (simpler) |
| Schema Generation | Automatic from type hints | Automatic from type hints | Tie |
| CLI Generation | Automatic per-tool | Not primary focus | TidyLLM |
| Async Support | Native with auto-detection | Async-first | Tie |
| Context Management | Simple injection | Rich context with logging/progress | FastMCP |
| Framework Integration | FastAPI adapter | Multiple integrations | FastMCP |
| Validation | Pydantic-based | Pydantic-based | Tie |
| Learning Curve | Minimal | Moderate | TidyLLM |

### Code Complexity Comparison

**TidyLLM Tool Definition**:
```python
@register(doc=read_prompt("calculator.md"))
def calculator(args: CalculatorArgs) -> CalculatorResult:
    """Perform basic mathematical operations."""
    return perform_calculation(args)
```

**FastMCP Equivalent**:
```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Calculator Service")

@mcp.tool()
async def calculator(args: CalculatorArgs) -> CalculatorResult:
    """Perform basic mathematical operations."""
    return perform_calculation(args)
```

### What Would Be Lost

1. **Automatic CLI Generation**: TidyLLM's automatic CLI for each tool would need reimplementation
2. **Simplicity**: FastMCP requires understanding MCP protocol and server/client architecture
3. **Direct Function Calls**: TidyLLM allows direct function execution; FastMCP is server-based
4. **Existing Codebase**: All current tools would need migration

### What Would Be Gained

1. **Rich Context**: Logging, progress reporting, user interaction capabilities
2. **Protocol Compliance**: Full MCP specification support
3. **Advanced Features**: Middleware, authentication, proxy capabilities
4. **Ecosystem**: Better integration with AI services (Anthropic, OpenAI)

### Migration Effort

**High-Level Tasks**:
1. Rewrite core registry system to use FastMCP server
2. Convert all existing tools to FastMCP format
3. Reimplement CLI generation (not built into FastMCP)
4. Update all tests and documentation
5. Handle breaking API changes for users

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks for full migration

### Risk Assessment

**Migration Risks**:
- Breaking changes for existing users
- Loss of unique features (automatic CLI)
- Increased complexity for simple use cases
- Dependency on external framework evolution

**Staying with TidyLLM Risks**:
- Missing out on MCP ecosystem benefits
- Need to maintain custom implementation
- Potential future incompatibility with AI services

## Recommendation Details

### Why Stay with TidyLLM

1. **Project Fit**: TidyLLM is purpose-built for the exact use case - simple tool management with automatic schema/CLI generation

2. **Unique Features**: The automatic CLI generation from function signatures is a killer feature not present in FastMCP

3. **Simplicity**: The decorator-based approach with zero configuration is more Pythonic and easier to adopt

4. **Working Solution**: Current implementation is clean, well-tested, and functional

5. **Migration Cost**: The effort to migrate (2-3 weeks) outweighs the benefits for current use cases

### Hybrid Approach (Alternative)

Consider adding a FastMCP adapter to TidyLLM:
```python
# Future possibility
from tidyllm.adapters.fastmcp import create_mcp_server

# Convert TidyLLM registry to MCP server
mcp_server = create_mcp_server(REGISTRY)
```

This would allow:
- Keep TidyLLM's simple API
- Export to MCP when needed
- No breaking changes
- Best of both worlds

## Conclusion

TidyLLM should remain the foundation for this project. Its focused approach on tool management with automatic schema and CLI generation provides unique value that FastMCP doesn't offer. While FastMCP has a richer feature set, those features aren't needed for the core use case of managing LLM tools.

The recommendation is to:
1. Continue developing TidyLLM
2. Consider adding MCP export capabilities as an adapter
3. Re-evaluate if requirements change to need MCP's advanced features (logging, progress, user interaction)
