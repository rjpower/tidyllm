# TidyLLM: Building Personal AI Applications That Just Work

## Executive Summary

TidyLLM is an Electron-based platform that makes it trivial to build and share personal AI-powered applications. By combining a unified data model, reusable tool ecosystem, and conversational interface, we enable users to create custom workflows in minutes rather than months.

Think of it as the "Spreadsheet of AI" – instantly usable, infinitely extensible, and designed for the kinds of data-oriented tasks that make up 80% of personal productivity needs.

## The Problem

Today's LLM applications suffer from three fundamental issues:

1. **Fragmentation**: Every app reinvents the wheel for data handling, UI, and tool integration
2. **Limited Expressiveness**: Chat interfaces alone can't handle complex, multi-step workflows
3. **Poor Reusability**: Code and workflows built for one use case can't easily be adapted for another

## Our Solution: A Three-Layer Architecture

### 1. Foundation Layer: Unified Data Model
- **JSON-W**: Extended JSON format supporting:
  - Binary data with MIME types
  - Native date/time handling
  - Tables and arrays with rich operations
  - Streaming data support
- **Automatic serialization** across Python, JavaScript, and other languages
- **SQL integration** for persistent storage and complex queries

### 2. Tool Layer: Reusable Components
- **Registry-based tool system** (see `@src/tidyllm/registry.py`)
- **FastAPI adapter** for automatic API generation
- **Type-safe interfaces** using Pydantic
- **Examples**: Audio transcription, vocabulary extraction, Anki integration

### 3. Experience Layer: Electron + Vite
- **Chat interface** as the primary interaction model
- **Embedded iframes** for rich, interactive components
- **Python backend** serving the Vite frontend
- **Playwright integration** for testing and automation

## Why This Architecture Matters

### For Users
- **Instant Usability**: Drag-and-drop files, type commands, get results
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start with chat, evolve to custom apps
- **Personal Data Control**: Everything runs locally with your own database

### For Developers
- **Rapid Development**: Build on existing tools rather than starting from scratch
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic models ensure data integrity across boundaries
- **Testing First**: Playwright support means you can test workflows like users experience them

## Core Innovation: TidyApps

TidyApps are self-contained AI workflows that combine:
- **Tools**: Registered functions with typed interfaces
- **Data Flow**: LINQ-style operations for data transformation
- **UI Components**: Optional Vite components for rich interaction
- **LLM Integration**: Natural language understanding and generation

### Example: Audio Transcription App
```python
@register()
def transcribe_with_vad(audio_source, target_language="en"):
    """Transcribe audio with automatic segmentation"""
    # 1. Segment audio using VAD
    segments = chunk_by_vad_stream(audio_from_source(audio_source))
    
    # 2. Transcribe each segment
    transcriptions = segments.try_select(transcribe_segment)
    
    # 3. Extract vocabulary
    new_words = extract_vocabulary(transcriptions)
    
    # 4. Interactive review
    selected = select_ui(new_words, "Select words to add")
    
    # 5. Add to database
    for word in selected:
        vocab_add(word)
```

## MVP Applications

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)
1. **Scan Journal**: OCR physical pages → Markdown notes
2. **Vocabulary Builder**: Audio/text → Anki cards with pronunciation
3. **Recipe Solver**: Ingredients → Weekly meal plans

### Phase 2: Integration (Months 3-4)
4. **Blog Recap**: Personal notes → Weekly summaries
5. **Code Assistant**: Context-aware development help
6. **Financial Tracker**: Receipts → Categorized expenses

### Phase 3: Platform (Months 5-6)
7. **App Builder**: Chat sessions → Standalone TidyApps
8. **Tool Marketplace**: Share and discover community tools
9. **Workflow Composer**: Visual pipeline builder

## Technical Roadmap

### Immediate (Week 1)
- [ ] Electron shell with embedded Python server
- [ ] Basic chat interface with tool execution
- [ ] Vite integration for frontend development

### Short Term (Month 1)
- [ ] JSON-W implementation with serialization
- [ ] Tool registry with type generation
- [ ] First three MVP apps functional

### Medium Term (Months 2-3)
- [ ] Plugin system for community tools
- [ ] Persistent chat history with workflow extraction
- [ ] Advanced UI components (tables, charts, media)

### Long Term (Months 4-6)
- [ ] Visual workflow builder
- [ ] Tool marketplace infrastructure
- [ ] Enterprise features (auth, permissions, monitoring)

## Missing Pieces & Open Questions

### Technical
1. **State Management**: How do we handle complex UI state across Python/JS boundary?
2. **Performance**: Can we achieve sub-100ms response times for common operations?
3. **Security**: How do we sandbox untrusted tools while maintaining functionality?

### Product
1. **Monetization**: Open source with paid hosting? Premium tools? Enterprise support?
2. **Community**: How do we incentivize high-quality tool contributions?
3. **Positioning**: Developer tool or end-user product?

### Implementation
1. **Database Choice**: SQLite for simplicity or PostgreSQL for features?
2. **IPC Mechanism**: WebSockets, gRPC, or native Electron IPC?
3. **Testing Strategy**: How much can we automate with Playwright?

## Why Now?

1. **LLMs are ready**: Modern models can reliably generate small, focused code
2. **Electron is mature**: Cross-platform desktop apps are now trivial to distribute
3. **Personal AI demand**: Users want AI that works with their data, not cloud services
